These events are planned so far in advance that the timing must have been coincidental, though the Valley is a small place where secrets are hard to keep. Still, my favorable impression of all the bulletins from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex\" target=\"_blank\">Googleplex</a>&nbsp;was not the result of failing to get a WWDC ticket during the two hours they were available before <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2012/04/why-apples-wwdc-2012-conference-sold-out-again-in-just-2-hours-again.php\" target=\"_blank\">selling out</a>. No, the vague premonition of big news from the 'Plex had been building for some time. I just didn't think it would be about someone leaving.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">For those too captivated by Baingate to have heard about Marrisa Mayer being appointed <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/07/marissa_mayer_yahoo_s_ceo_is_in_over_her_head_and_that_s_just_how_she_likes_it_.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo's new CEO</a>, let's just say that the day after that announcement brought even bigger news about her pregnancy. Amid the roiling <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/07/17/new-yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-is-pregnant-does-it-matter/\" target=\"_blank\">controversy</a> that outed closet chauvinists here and abroad, one fact remained clear and incontrovertible. This is one driven person.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Her technical and business chops notwithstanding (two CS degrees from&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Stanford, early first-string offense at the 'Plex), Mayer brings the one thing Yahoo needs to survive: what we in the recently rediscovered Brooklyn of my youth call <em>chutzpah</em>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Let's look at who runs the Big Four.</span></p><table style=\"width: 200px;\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"assets/facebook_100.jpg\" alt=\"facebook\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom;\"></td><td><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Zuckerberg</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><img src=\"assets/google_120.jpg\" alt=\"google\" width=\"120\" height=\"43\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom;\"></td><td><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Page/Brin</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Schmidt</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><img src=\"assets/amazon_120.jpg\" alt=\"amazon\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom;\"></td><td><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Bezos</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><img src=\"assets/apple_120.jpg\" alt=\"apple\" width=\"120\" height=\"148\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom;\"></td><td><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Spirit of Steve Jobs</strong></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Oh, and the fifth wheel in this new world order?&nbsp;</span></p><table style=\"width: 400px; height: 100px;\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"assets/microsoft_114.jpg\" alt=\"microsoft\" width=\"113\" height=\"37\"></td><td><p><strong style=\"font-size: large;\"><br></strong></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>The other Steve</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Not exactly a bunch of wallflowers. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yahoo still has great technology.
