Aggregating posts from many different bloggers in a compact print format that's customizable by geographical region seemed to be a unique business model. It fit my idea of a blended portfolio of organizational and personal brands, the old AOL \"family of brands\" gambit punched up for the 21st century. That's what I see as the winning strategy for newspapers: allowing readers to assemble their own branded collection of content, interacting under the corporate brand, but modifying it according to personal taste.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also thought The Printed Blog represented the greening of an industry that is <em>ipso facto </em>the antithesis of sustainability. Why print all the news, even in the age of recycling, if you only want to read some of it? After a flawed first attempt (when printing, be sure to select \"Scale down larger pages\"), I ran off my copy and put it on the stack of reading I optimistically maintain in one corner of my desk. I haven't finished it, but I like the fact that The Printed Blog encapsulates an online experience in a form I can take with me when I leave the house. That's still the value proposition: paper is portable. So are digital devices, but they don't fit the use case, the social consumption model that says you might want to sit in a coffee shop and read something other than a screen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Printed Blog is a brand, like any other 'zine in hard copy or online.ï¿½&nbsp; It's currently available in pdf format. Should it also be online, in its own digital layout? Perhaps. Those of us who kill trees for a living would doubtlessly feel we were doing our part, but I guess the whole point is to sell the hard copy, though it's given away free at the moment. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/technology/start-ups/22blogpaper.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">thinks that's cute</a>. Yeah, about as cute as the Web was in the beginning, and look what happened.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is this the blended brand that lights the way for newspapers? Too early to tell, but it's worth watching.</p>"
