Just when he agrees with <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/tag/shields-and-brooks/\" target=\"_blank\">his PBS sparring partner Mark Shields</a> on the obvious, like the predicament of a GOP being Trumped at every turn, he shoots himself in the foot, or puts it in his mouth. I've come to expect this rhetorical <em>pas de deux</em>. It's tough being a Republican shill and a New York Times columnist who occasionally blogs for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.commentarymagazine.com/author/david-brooks/\" target=\"_blank\">Commentary.</a>&nbsp;As Groucho Marx said: \"Those are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others.\"</p><p>But Brooks' latest <em>faux pas</em>, an op-ed piece about Ta-Nehisi Coates' new book <em>Between the World and Me</em>, redefines tone deafness. Under the scurrilous title <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/opinion/listening-to-ta-nehisi-coates-while-white.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"Listening to Ta-Nehisi Coates While White,\"</a> Brooks gives us passive-aggressive liberalism, socio-economic condescension and brittle revisionism.</p><p>The phrase \"driving while black\" (substitute any quotidian behavior) has real meaning for many, and it can be applied to <em>any </em>group: \"walking while gay,\" \"worshipping while Muslim,\" \"driving while transgender.\" But the skilled polemicist Brooks subsumes the narrative of police brutality, to which the phrase really applies, under the rubric of cultural bigotry.</p><p>Knee-jerk reactions to African-American literature are commonplace. It's no great surprise that Brooks has also written for <em>The Atlantic</em>, Coates' current employer. However, it's surprising, even shocking, to see the consistent bias. Brooks' 2003 piece <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/09/people-like-us/302774/\" target=\"_blank\">\"People Like Us,\"</a> its title a clumsy reference to the 1961 book <em>Black Like Me</em>, begins with this <em>tour de raison</em>: \"Maybe it's time to admit the obvious. We don't really care about diversity all that much in America, even though we talk about it a great deal.\" He goes on to talk about paying \"lip service to the melting pot,\" ending with an inflammatory Trumpism: \"Look around at your daily life. Are you really in touch with the broad diversity of American life? Do you care?\"</p><p>For the record, Brooks' colleague, chief book critic Michiko Kakutani, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/books/review-in-between-the-world-and-me-ta-nehisi-coates-delivers-a-desperate-dispatch-to-his-son.html\" target=\"_blank\">recognized Coates' brilliance for what it is</a>. Correctly citing James Baldwin as Coates' inspiration, she calls his book \"a searing meditation on what it means to be black in America today.\" Brooks unabashedly lifts the blurb, beginning his epistolary piece in similar fashion: \"Your new book, �Between the World and Me,� (sic) is a great and searing contribution to this public education.\" The condescension comes quickly: \"But the disturbing challenge of your book is your rejection of the American dream. My ancestors chose to come here.\"</p><p>After an obligatory reference to pogroms, Brooks continues: \"Your ancestors came in chains. In your book the dream of the comfortable suburban life is a 'fairy tale.' For you, slavery is the original American sin, from which there is no redemption.\"</p><p>The puerile statements abound, building to a climax worthy of inclusion in revisionist Texas school books:</p><p>\"I think you distort American history. This country, like each person in it, is a mixture of glory and shame. There�s a Lincoln for every Jefferson Davis and a Harlem Children�s Zone for every K.K.K. � and usually vastly more than one.\"</p><p>He's talking about a book Coates wrote as a letter to his son, a father's message meant as therapy for himself as a writer. But Brooks can't see this, and I fault him for that. Actually, I dislike him for that, and I'm not alone. This <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/listening-to-ta-nehisi-coates-whilst-snuggled-deep-with-1718506352\" target=\"_blank\">parody of his letter</a> says it all (thanks to <a href=\"http://mije.org/richardprince/fox-news-missing-uproar-over-jail-death#coates\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Prince</a> for finding it.)</p><p>I'll still watch PBS NewsHour, because it's a good take on Beltway antics. I can even stomach Brooks' apologia of the GOP, an asymptotic process as the party becomes decreasingly relevant to the American narrative. However, it's no longer about respect for Brooks, but tolerance - a sentiment with which he should become familiar.</p>"
