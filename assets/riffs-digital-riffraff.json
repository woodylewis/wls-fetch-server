We also understand that to riff on something is to perform theme and variation on&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 36.90972137451172px;\">a topic. <a href=\"http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lenny Bruce</a> was a master at this.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Since the beginning of 2013, I've been riffing as a digital architect. This is not the independent gig I had last year, when half a dozen clients paid me to orchestrate and perform pieces of varying length. Instead of those improvisations, I now </span><span style=\"line-height: 36.90972137451172px;\">play in a larger ensemble, composing and arranging for content management systems, the symphonic foundation of social publishing.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">We engage our clients in thrilling discussions about taxonomies, semantic frameworks, and user experience. Workflow, process reengineering - it's all good - and yet at the end of all this, I can't shake the feeling that all this activity concerns just another in a series of ordinary web sites.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: small; line-height: normal; padding-bottom: 50px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Don't get me wrong. I like what I do, and I'm good at it. But it's been awhile since I've heard an original riff. That's why I was even more blown away than I expected, when I started Jaron Lanier's book,</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZFXUBO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZFXUBO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=woodylewis-20\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;You Are Not a Gadget</a>.</em></p><p style=\"font-size: small; line-height: normal; padding-bottom: 50px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">I first started following Jaron in the 80s, when he and several other pioneers of virtual reality were way ahead of the pack - too far ahead, as it turned out, because our computers were not powerful enough,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 36.90972137451172px;\">and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">the public imagination wasn't ready.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: small; line-height: normal; padding-bottom: 50px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Jared's riff is different now. He is still well-regarded in Silicon Valley, a place he now regards with skepticism, despite his roots. He riffs on <em>lock-in</em>, a wonderful term he uses to describe the fixed point of view I see in most web sites today. Lock-in freezes a perspective that might appear&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 36.90972137451172px;\">brilliant at the</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;moment, but risks becoming a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Maginot Line</a></span><em style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">.</a></em></p><p style=\"font-size: small; line-height: normal; padding-bottom: 50px;\"><em style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"></a></em><span style=\"line-height: 36.90972137451172px;\">That's what I see around me: predictable ideas locked in a box of predictable design. It's the path of least resistance, of course, because communication occurs along the lowest common denominator, the plane of aesthetic consensus. While I shy away from some of Jared's socio-economic analysis, I agree that we need a radical crescendo to break free of the coda.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: small; line-height: normal; padding-bottom: 50px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Enough of the fractured musical metaphors. It's time to find a new riff. </span></p>"
